# Third-party licences in D4Mac.app

The D4Mac launcher itself is **proprietary** — all rights reserved
(see `LICENSE`). The `.app` bundle additionally ships the following
third-party components, each retaining its own licence and listed here
to satisfy redistribution obligations.

## Apple Game Porting Toolkit 3.0

**Files in bundle**:
- `Contents/SharedSupport/Wine/lib/external/D3DMetal.framework/`
- `Contents/SharedSupport/Wine/lib/external/libd3dshared.dylib`
- `Contents/SharedSupport/Wine/lib/wine/x86_64-windows/d3d12.dll`
- `Contents/SharedSupport/Wine/lib/wine/x86_64-windows/dxgi.dll`
- `Contents/SharedSupport/Wine/lib/wine/x86_64-windows/d3d11.dll`
- `Contents/SharedSupport/Wine/lib/wine/x86_64-windows/atidxx64.dll`
- `Contents/SharedSupport/Wine/lib/wine/x86_64-windows/nvapi64.dll`
- `Contents/SharedSupport/Wine/lib/wine/x86_64-windows/nvngx.dll`

**Licence**: Apple GPTK Licence, redistributable per clause (i)(iii)
*"distribute the Apple Software solely for non-commercial purposes."*
The unmodified `License.pdf` is included in `Contents/Resources/` per
that clause's requirements.

**Source**: [Apple Game Porting Toolkit 3.0 release archive](https://developer.apple.com/games/game-porting-toolkit/)

**Critical**: D4Mac and any fork **may not be sold or bundled into a
commercial product** while these binaries are present. Distributing for
free public download is the only redistribution path Apple's licence
permits.

## Wine 11.0

**Files in bundle**: everything else under `Contents/SharedSupport/Wine/`,
notably:
- `bin/{wine, wineserver, wineloader, …}`
- `lib/wine/x86_64-windows/wined3d.dll` and other Wine PE modules
- `lib/wine/x86_64-unix/{ntdll, kernel32, …}.so`
- `share/wine/wine.inf`

**Licence**: GNU Lesser General Public Licence 2.1 (LGPL-2.1).

**Source**: built from CodeWeavers' CrossOver 26.1 LGPL source release
at [media.codeweavers.com/pub/crossover/source/](https://media.codeweavers.com/pub/crossover/source/),
with no additional patches in our scaffolding (the `dlls/winemetal/` etc.
directories from earlier development were removed from the build —
D4Mac uses Apple's GPTK PE forwarders instead). The complete
corresponding source is available at the upstream URL.

## MoltenVK

**Files in bundle**: `Contents/SharedSupport/Wine/lib/external/libMoltenVK.dylib`

**Licence**: Apache 2.0.

**Source**: [github.com/KhronosGroup/MoltenVK](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/MoltenVK).
Used as a fallback for the vkd3d code path; D3DMetal does not depend on
it but bundling allows games that prefer Vulkan/MoltenVK to run.

## Microsoft Visual C++ 2015-2022 Redistributable

**Files in bundle**:
- `Contents/Resources/Prereqs/vc_redist.x86.exe`
- `Contents/Resources/Prereqs/vc_redist.x64.exe`

**Licence**: Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Licence Terms.
Microsoft permits redistribution alongside applications that depend on
it (which BNet's CEF subprocesses do). The full licence is at
[aka.ms/VCRedistLicense](https://aka.ms/VCRedistLicense).

**Source**: official Microsoft installers fetched from `aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.{x86,x64}.exe`
by `Prereqs/fetch.sh`. Files are unmodified.

## Microsoft Core Fonts For The Web

**Files in bundle**: none — D4Mac symlinks the macOS-bundled copies of
these fonts at first launch.

`/System/Library/Fonts/Supplemental/{Arial, Times New Roman, Courier
New, Georgia, Verdana, Trebuchet MS, Tahoma, Comic Sans MS, Impact,
Webdings, Wingdings}.ttf` are licensed by Apple for use on macOS via
their own agreement with Microsoft. We create symbolic links from these
into the Wine bottle's `c:\windows\Fonts\` so Windows apps find them by
expected filename. **No font files are copied or distributed by D4Mac.**

If a future macOS removes these fonts, D4Mac will silently skip the ones
not present. Users can run `winetricks corefonts` inside the bottle as a
fallback (downloads from the original SourceForge mirror).

## DXMT v0.72

**Files in bundle**:
- `Contents/SharedSupport/Wine/lib/external/dxmt/i386-windows/{d3d11,d3d10core,dxgi,winemetal}.dll`
- `Contents/SharedSupport/Wine/lib/external/dxmt/x86_64-windows/{d3d11,d3d10core,dxgi,winemetal,nvapi64,nvngx}.dll`
- `Contents/SharedSupport/Wine/lib/external/dxmt/x86_64-unix/winemetal.so`
- The 32-bit DLLs are deployed to `bottle/drive_c/windows/syswow64/` at first
  run, replacing Wine's reimpl with DXMT's D3D11→Metal translator. The
  unix bridge is also installed at `lib/wine/x86_64-unix/winemetal.so`.

**Why bundled**: Battle.net's CEF (Chromium Embedded Framework) is 32-bit
and needs a real D3D11 backend. Apple's GPTK ships only 64-bit D3D11
forwarders, so without DXMT the BNet launcher window fails to render.
With DXMT in syswow64 + D3DMetal in system32, the runtime supports both
D3D11 (BNet) and D3D12 (Diablo IV) simultaneously.

**Licence**: MIT (Copyright 2023 Feifan He). See
`lib/external/dxmt/LICENSE` in the bundle. v0.81+ switched to LGPL; we
ship v0.72 to keep the MIT terms.

**Source**: [github.com/3Shain/dxmt](https://github.com/3Shain/dxmt) at
the v0.72 tag.
